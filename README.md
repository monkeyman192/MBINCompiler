# MBINCompiler

*Updated version to Emoose's project originally found here:* https://github.com/emoose/MBINCompiler

As emoose doesn't seem to be updating MBINCompiler for support with NMS v1.1, we are updating the program ourselves.

Already a fair few new files can be decompiled, however there is still a bit of work to go until this is fully compatible with 1.1

This updated version would not have been possible without theFisher86 and grekwaste.
